When was the last time you’ve had to manually review your organization’s performance? Or resolve all the queries the employee got? It’s been a long time thanks to the Chatbots, they have empowered HR professionals to spend less time on the tactical details of their jobs and to concentrate on more strategic elements.

Chatbots are rising in popularity for there usage in organization — employee queries are answered accurately and immediately. [A report from Juniper Research](http://fortune.com/2017/05/10/chatbots-business-billions-savings/) forecasts that this technology could save businesses $8 billion annually worldwide by 2022, up from the $20 million employers are expected to save in 2017.

Conversational AI in HR is emerging these days since it because of it benefits it provides for the development of organization. Here is a glimpse of how it helps organization

1.  **Saved time and increased efficiency  
    **Automating the process increases the productivity rate of the HR team and also makes the work hassle-free. Chatbot provides a helping hand to HR to better manage their tasks and improve productivity.
2.  **Quick & Accurate Response  
    **Employees no longer need to spend time tracking down a manager or HR employee to ask a question or email them and wait for a response. They can talk to the bot using their mobile device the second they need an answer.
3.  **Improved the employee experience  
    **Chatbots can solve all the basic queries of the employee to check their leave balance, apply for leave, payable tax and more
4.  **Onboarding New Employee  
    **When a new employee is hired, the onboarding process tends to be repeatable and many questions from new staff members are predictable. The same applies to many parts of the training process for new employees.
5.  **Hiring  
    **Chatbots are helping in making the application process more transparent. If applicants have questions about job descriptions, potential responsibilities or company details, they can simply ask the Chatbot.  
    Candidate Pre Interview Screening is a good example where chatbots collect some of the details from the candidate and makes HR work way lot easier.
6.  **Sentiment Analysis  
    **HR chatbot can ask employees a series of short, simple questions over a period of days or weeks instead of requesting feedback from forms or emails. This way, HR receives important employee data and are enabled to make decisions about processes or regulations.  
    As a byproduct of receiving data from employees in real-time, Chatbots can also be trained to evaluate, measure, and understand employee sentiment so management can work to solve issues before they become big problems.
7.  **Employee Reviews  
    **Employee reviews typically take a company months to complete. Forms, interviews, and surveys create a manual process that halts employee productivity. Management must be responsible for reading and responding to all of these forms, which prohibits them from functioning at productive levels. In addition, most organizations find it challenging to make use of the data they collected because it’s buried in forms or email threads.

> For the most part, chatbots are great for any process that is repeatable and anything that has predictable questions.
